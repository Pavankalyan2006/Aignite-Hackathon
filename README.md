<strong>🚀 IntelliHealth Assistant</strong>




<em>Your AI-Powered Health Companion for a Unified & Empowered Life.</em>

📖 Project Description
<br>
<b>✨ Problem Statement:</b> How Might We transform the fragmented and often stressful daily chore of health management into a simple, unified, and empowering experience for everyone, especially those managing chronic conditions?<br>

<b>💡 Proposed Solution: </b>IntelliHealth Assistant is a mobile-first web application that acts as a single, intelligent source of truth for a user's well-being. It replaces the chaos of juggling multiple health apps with a unified dashboard. Our solution's core innovation is its ability to synthesize—it uses the Gemini AI to connect a user's personal health profile, daily activities, and real-time environmental factors to provide holistic, actionable guidance. Key features include an AI-powered Diet & Activity Planner, an on-demand "Mindful Moment" generator for mental wellness, and an AI Doctor Advisor that demystifies medical reports.

<b>🎯 Target Users / Use Cases:</b> Our primary users are individuals seeking a proactive approach to their health, including:

Patients managing chronic conditions (e.g., Diabetes, Asthma).

Elderly individuals who need a simple, accessible tool for daily health tracking.

Health-conscious users experiencing "app fatigue" from using too many disconnected services.

Caregivers who need to monitor the well-being of a loved one.

<b>🔬 Methodology</b>
<b>Research & Ideation –</b> We identified the critical user pain point of "app fatigue" in the digital health space. Our brainstorming focused on creating a solution centered on intelligent synthesis rather than just data tracking.

<b>Design –</b> The UI/UX was designed with a "Calm Technology" philosophy, using a neutral color palette and a clean, card-based interface to reduce user anxiety. The system was architected using a scalable, serverless backend (Firebase) and a powerful large language model (Gemini API).

<b>Develop –</b> We built a high-fidelity, fully functional prototype (intellihealth_app.html) that implements secure user authentication, a real-time Firestore database, and live API calls to the Gemini API for all core intelligent features.

<b>Test –</b> We conducted rigorous functional testing on the prototype to ensure a seamless user journey, from onboarding to real-time data updates and AI interactions.

<b>Deploy –</b> Our prototype is a self-contained, deployable static web application, serving as a robust proof-of-concept for the project's viability.

<b>Future Scope –</b> Our roadmap includes deeper personalization through symptom and mood tracking, integration with wearable devices via Apple HealthKit and Google Fit, AI-powered grocery list generation, and a secure, view-only Caregiver Mode.
