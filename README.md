📖 Project Description
<br><br><br>
<b>✨ Problem Statement:</b> How Might We transform the fragmented and often stressful daily chore of health management into a simple, unified, and empowering experience for everyone, especially those managing chronic conditions?<br><br><br>

<b>💡 Proposed Solution: </b>IntelliHealth Assistant is a mobile-first web application that acts as a single, intelligent source of truth for a user's well-being. It replaces the chaos of juggling multiple health apps with a unified dashboard. Our solution's core innovation is its ability to synthesize and create a truly interconnected ecosystem for health. It uses an LLM to connect a user's personal health profile, daily activities, and real-time environmental factors into a single, constantly evolving health plan.

The platform operates on a principle of dynamic interconnectivity: all features are linked, and an update in one area instantly triggers relevant adjustments across the entire system. For example, if the Continuous Health Monitoring module detects a high blood sugar reading, it doesn't just generate a report. It automatically refines the Today's Meal Plan to suggest low-glycemic foods, alerts the Live Activity Tracking to recommend a post-meal walk, and updates the user's overall Health Metrics. This principle applies to everything; logging a meal, completing a yoga session, or noting a symptom will cause all related plans and advice to adapt in real-time.

This core adaptive system is supported by other features like a smart Medication Schedule, an Environmental Advisor, an Acute Symptom Advisor for immediate guidance, and Ayurvedic Home Remedies. All this data is synthesized into a clear overview, empowering users with a truly holistic, responsive, and AI-driven health management experience where every component works in sync.
<br>

<b>🎯 Target Users / Use Cases:</b> Our primary users are individuals seeking a proactive approach to their health, including:

Patients managing chronic conditions (e.g., Diabetes, Asthma).

Elderly individuals who need a simple, accessible tool for daily health tracking.

Health-conscious users experiencing "app fatigue" from using too many disconnected services.

Caregivers who need to monitor the well-being of a loved one.

<b>🔬 Methodology</b>
<hr>
<br>
<b>Research & Ideation –</b> We identified the critical user pain point of "app fatigue" in the digital health space. Our brainstorming focused on creating a solution centered on intelligent synthesis rather than just data tracking.
<br><br>
<b>Design –</b> The UI/UX was designed with a "Calm Technology" philosophy, using a neutral color palette and a clean, card-based interface to reduce user anxiety. The system was architected using a scalable, serverless backend (Firebase) and a powerful large language model .
<br><br>
<b>Develop –</b> We built a high-fidelity, fully functional prototype (https://aignite-red.vercel.app) that implements secure user authentication, a real-time Firestore database, and live API calls to the  Large Language Models for all core intelligent features.
<br><br>
<b>Test –</b> We conducted rigorous functional testing on the prototype to ensure a seamless user journey, from onboarding to real-time data updates and AI interactions.
<br><br>
<b>Deploy –</b> Our prototype is a self-contained, deployable static web application, serving as a robust proof-of-concept for the project's viability.
<br><br>
<b>Future Scope –</b>  Our roadmap focuses on extending the user experience beyond the phone. The next major step is Smartwatch Integration (for Wear OS and watchOS). This will allow the application to send timely, glanceable notifications directly to the user's wrist for critical events like medication times, meal alerts from the AI diet plan, and hydration reminders, ensuring users never miss an important health event.
